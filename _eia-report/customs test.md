Importers may be penalised if they do not comply with the requirements imposed under the Customs Act, the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (RIEA), and their subsidiary legislation.

<b>Examples of Common Errors and Corrective Actions</b>
<ul class="jekyllcodex_accordion">
<li>
    <input id="accordion1" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion1">For errors made in an import permit, please take note of the following:</label>
<div>
	<ul>
				<li><b>Import permit is not utilised</b><br>
					You may submit an <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/permit-amendments-and-cancellation">amendment or cancellation</a> request via TradeNet and specify the reason for amendments (e.g. extend permit validity) or cancellation. Certain permit fields are not amendable if there are controlled, prohibited or dutiable goods involved. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/national-single-window/overview/annexes-and-appendices">list of non-amendable fields</a> for more information. If you are unable to amend or cancel the permit, you may wish to lodge a <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/compliance/voluntary-disclosure-programme">Voluntary Disclosure</a> to Customs. 
If the payment permit cannot be amended or cancelled, you may submit a refund request via TradeNet and specify the reason for refund. There is no need for you to submit a Voluntary Disclosure to Customs.
		</li></ul>
	<ul>
        <li><b>Import permit is utilised</b><br>
Amendments and cancellation are generally not allowed for import permits which have been utilised for clearance. If you have detected any errors in such permits where amendment or cancellation is not allowed, you may wish to lodge a <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/compliance/voluntary-disclosure-programme">Voluntary Disclosure</a> to Customs.</li>
	</ul>
    </div>
	</li>
<li>
	<input id="accordion2" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion2">For errors made in a utilised Major Exporter permit, please take note of the following:</label>
<div>
      <ul>
				<li><b>Information wrongly declared on an In-Non-Payment (Approved premises/ schemes) permit by an approved Major Exporter Scheme (MES) trader</b><br>
If the permit was utilised for cargo clearance, the approved MES trader should inform the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) of the correction(s) to be made during the MES trader’s periodic reporting in GST returns to IRAS. The corrections are to be supported by the relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents).
				</li></ul>
	<ul>
				<li><b>Wrong importer name and UEN declared</b><br>
The declaring Agent (DA) needs to obtain a replacement In-Non-Payment "Approved Premises/Schemes" (INP-APS) permit with the correct MES trader declared as the importer. Thereafter, the DA should email a copy of the original permit and replacement permit together with the relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents) to Permits Unit, attention: Permits Officer, at <a href="mailto:customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg">customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg</a>
					with the email subject title "Request to invalidate unused replacement permit for a permit with incorrect MES trader declared as the importer" to request for invalidation of the unused replacement permit. Only the importer’s name and UEN should be amended; all other permit fields should remain unchanged.
</li>
				</ul>
    </div>
  </li>
<li>
	<input id="accordion3" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion3">For errors made in a utilised In-Payment permit, please take note of the following:</label>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>A payment permit was taken up instead of an In-Non-Payment "Approved Premises/Schemes" (INP-APS) permit for a MES trader</b><br>
The In-Non-Payment "Approved Premises/Schemes" (INP-APS) permit should be obtained at the time of importation. A replacement permit is not required as the In-Payment (IPT) permit had been utilised i.e. used for cargo clearance. If you are the DA and had paid the GST, you may approach the importer for the reimbursement of GST paid. The importer can claim the GST paid as input tax in his GST return to IRAS.</li>	
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wrong importer declared in an In-Payment permit</b><br>
For a payment permit with the wrong importer details, a replacement payment permit with the correct importer’s UEN and name must be obtained for the said consignment. Please note that for incorrect foreign values declared, the <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/customs-exchange-rates">exchange rates</a> to be declared shall be based on the initial permit. The importer or DA may submit a request for <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/refund-of-duties-and-gst">refund</a> of the duty and/or GST paid for the wrong permit via TradeNet and specify the reason for refund.</li></ul>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wrong value of goods declared in an In-Payment permit</b><br>
A <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/apply-short-payment-permit">short-payment permit application</a> is required to be taken up to account for the short-fall in duty and/or GST paid for goods that had been imported and declared previously. If there is any over-payment or wrong payment of duties and/or GST, the importer or DA may submit a request for <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/refund-of-duties-and-gst">refund</a> of the duty and/or GST paid for the wrong permit via TradeNet and specify the reason for refund.</li></ul>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wrong information declared in a customs permit</b><br>
		If you are unable to amend the permit, you may wish to lodge a <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/compliance/voluntary-disclosure-programme">Voluntary Disclosure</a> to Customs.</li>
