				<p style="text-align: justify;">Kent Ridge Secondary School is committed to providing a student-centric and values-driven education to all our students. We recognise our students’ potential and talents in both academic and non-academic areas and develop them holistically through our programmes. In line with this, we are offering DSA for students who have the talents in Badminton, Basketball, Floorball and Computational Thinking Skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The DSA scheme, introduced in 2004, provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</p>

<div class="panel"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Students eligible must qualify for the Express or Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) course based on MOE’s admission criteria.</span></div>

<p><button class="accordion">Will my child/ward be part of the associated CCA if he/she is successful in the respective DSA-Sec application?</button></p>
<div class="panel">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yes, your child/ward will be automatically channelled into the Infocomm Club as his/her CCA through the DSA - Sec Exercise if he/she has applied via DSA - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (Computational Thinking Skills) or Badminton/Basketball/Floorball if he/she has applied via DSA – Sports and Games. Hence, your child/ward will not be involved in the CCA Selection Process during the Sec 1 CCA Orientation Week.</span></p>
</div>
<p><button class="accordion">Does my child/ward have to take the PSLE after receiving a Confirmed Offer or been placed on Waiting List?</button></p>
<div class="panel">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Students who take up Confirmed Offers or are placed on Waiting List by schools during the DSA-Sec Exercise are still required to take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Those who take up Confirmed Offers are guaranteed a place in the school that has extended them an offer, provided that their PSLE results meet the <strong>minimum</strong> requirement for a course [Express / Normal (Academic) /Normal (Technical)] offered by the school.</span></p>
</div>
<p><button class="accordion">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can my child/ward apply for transfer after accepting the Confirmed Offer from DSA-Sec school?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</button></p>
<div class="panel">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Similar to previous years, students who have been admitted to a school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not be able to participate in the centralised Secondary One Posting Exercise.</span></p>
<p>Students who have been successfully allocated to a school via the DSA-Sec Exercise are expected to honour their commitment to their posted DSA-Sec schools and will thus not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results.</p>
</div>
<p><button class="accordion">I’m an international student. Am I eligible to apply for DSA-Sec? I am not sitting for PSLE/not from an MOE mainstream school; can I apply for DSA-Sec?</button></p>
<div class="panel">
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a Singapore Citizen, Permanent Resident, or an International Student who is residing in Singapore and holding a valid pass, you may take part in this DSA-Sec.&nbsp; International/Foreign student are required to take and fulfil the requirements of the Admission Exercise for International Students (AEIS) conducted by Ministry of Education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All International Students who are not residing in Singapore&nbsp;are not&nbsp;eligible to take part in DSA-Sec, but may consider to take part in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students/aeis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS)</a>&nbsp;for admission into mainstream secondary schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For more details, please refer to <a href="https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOE-website</a>.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yes, you can indicate up to 3 choices, 3 talent areas and maximum of 2 choices for the same school for the DSA-Sec Exercise. However, parents and students are encouraged to choose schools based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent and the distance of the schools from home.</span></p>
</div>
<p><button class="accordion">If I have been informed that I am successful in my application, do I have to accept the offer immediately?</button></p>
<div class="panel">
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no need to accept any offer during the DSA-Sec exercise period. Students who are given Confirmed Offers or placed on Waiting List will only exercise their DSA- Sec School Preference from 31 October 2022 – 4 November 2022.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MOE will issue the DSA-Sec School Preference Form to successful DSA-Sec students (Confirmed Offers or Waiting List Offers) through a SMS and email from Postman.gov.sg&nbsp; The email provides you with instructions to submit school preferences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Preference Form template from your email (sent via Postman) will show all the offers that the student has received and he is required to indicate his first choice, second choice, etc. Upon the release of PSLE results in November you will be informed of your posted school. Once you are posted to a school via your DSA-Sec Exercise, you will not participate in the MOE S1 Posting Exercise based on PSLE results and will not be allowed to transfer to other secondary schools.</p>
